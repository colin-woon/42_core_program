- **.checkout_git** - the actual .git configurations for my passed project, just rename to .git to see 'git logs' for commit history
- **.ignoring_git** - used for temporarily ignoring git repo to sync between remote and local progress without using git submodule commands *(this is my own workflow, allows me to save a lot of space on my 42KL iMac without needing to have many individual copies of project repositories for remote work)*
