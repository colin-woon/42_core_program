- **.git_checkout** - the actual .git configurations for my passed project, just rename to .git to see `git logs` for commit history
- **.git_ignore** - used for temporarily ignoring git repo to sync between remote and local progress without using git submodule commands *(this is my own workflow, allows me to save a lot of space on my 42KL iMac without having many individual copies of project repositories for remote work, with this I only require 1 repository for all projects when I'm away from campus)*
